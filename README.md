# Capstone_Frontend
Capstone Project- ✨The Happiest Store on Earth✨ 

✨ Overview of E-Commerce Site
This is a basic e-commerce website built as a school coding project, showcasing a collection of stock Disney-themed merchandise. Users can (for the most part) browse products, click into each item and see the product details, add and remove items from their shopping cart, and view their cart. They are taken to a "checkout" page upon checkout, and can then navigate back to the store. All product images and names are used as placeholders. 

As a guest without an account you can only view the products, or create an account. Upon login, you can then proceed with the cart features.
 
As an admin, you can view all users and products. You can also add products to the site. The remove and edit features; however, are currently disabled pending future updates...
 
This is a React application.
