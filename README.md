Capstone_Frontend

This is a basic e-commerc website built as a school coding project, showcasing a collection of stock Disney-themed merchandise. Users can (hopefully) browse products, click into each item and see the product details, add items to a shopping cart, and simulate a simple checkout process. All product images and names are used as placeholders.
 
 As an admin, you can view users, as well as user- carts. You can make updates to the carts as needed, and add products to the site.
